# Personal-Study-Syllabus
Computer Science and Maths Personal Syllabus

After examining one university syllabus, I had the idea that I could get some of the knowledge benefits from it by formalising my own approach to studying both maths and computer science.

Having left education at 16, I don't have a formal background in these subjects though I've spent time programming and had one junior level commercial role (using C#/VB and SQL).

The more interesting roles require more maths and algorithmic knowledge, at least in the areas I've become interested in. Some of these include machine learning.

This initial commit is the very start where I'm organising the general syllabus I think I need for my interests. Later I hope to include knowledge maps for some concepts.

As far as language goes, I began in .Net and have a liking for F#. Using a multi paradigm approach seems most expedient, therefore my main language will be F# though where useful either Matlab/Octave and R will be used.

Online MOOC's will provide a lot of detailed lectures, thus allowing me to mix and match. These sources will be linked and credited as appropriate, the same goes for the textbooks I use to support the online work.

In addition, [http://KhanAcademy.org/](http://KhanAcademy.org/ "Khan Academy"), [http://www.Betterexplained.com]("Better Explained") and [http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/](http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/ "Paul's Notes") will be additional resources.

The order of study is subject to change as I've a reasonable idea, in general, of what I don't know but realise as I dig into this, I'll find more that I don't know that I didn't know.
